# 项目上下文信息

- User wants to convert the current Next.js full-stack blog application to a separated frontend-backend architecture. The frontend should be a standalone React application (potentially using Vite) and the backend will be implemented in Rust in the future. The conversion should preserve all essential frontend functionality while removing server-side Next.js features.
- Analysis completed: Current Next.js blog has clear server/client separation. Server-side: API routes in src/app/api/, blog-server.ts with fs operations, middleware.ts for auth, server components. Client-side: React components in src/components/, contexts, HomeClient.tsx, admin components. User chose to start with setting up new React frontend project and migrating client components. Conversion plan uses Vite + React + TypeScript with React Router, preserving all styling and components.
- Frontend-backend separation project completed successfully. Created standalone React frontend in frontend-new/ directory with Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS. All 7 tasks completed: setup, component migration, routing, API client, build config, API documentation, and testing. Frontend builds successfully and includes comprehensive mock data. Ready for Rust backend integration using documented API endpoints.
- AI Chat功能迁移完成：成功将原始项目的ChatAssistant组件迁移到frontend项目，包括完整的UI、动画、API对接、聊天历史持久化等功能。前端使用framer-motion，后端使用Rust chat接口，功能测试完全正常。
- 用户要求根据DevDoc.md文档审查后端代码，查找未实现的功能模块
